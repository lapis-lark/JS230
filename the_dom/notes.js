/*
  a node is a single point in the node tree, such the document, elements, text, and comments
  document node is top most node; query selector must be called on a node, so document works for 
  searching all nodes

  node type matters because different types have different methods

  array-like objects have a length and an indexed collection of elements, but forEach cannot
  be used on them usually; convert to an array or use for loops ~

  call currentTarget on the default value of argument (not undefined?) to target the outer element. . .
  like this for elements?
